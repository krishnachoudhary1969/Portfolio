        <h2>ABOUT ME </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Krishna Choudhary, a passionate developer with a strong
          interest in creating innovative and useful applications. I enjoy
          working with various technologies and solving real-world problems
          through code. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p><h2>Skills :</h2></p>
        <br>
        <ul>
        <p>
          <li>
          Web Development: I have hands-on experience with HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript, which I’ve used to build dynamic websites and web
          applications. I recently worked on a web application called "The Odin
          Recipes," where users can browse and view recipes for their favorite
          dishes like Pizza, Burger, and Noodles. I also integrated basic
          interactivity to make the user experience seamless.
          </li>
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          <li>Face Recognition and Machine Learning: I’ve worked with OpenCV and
          machine learning algorithms to create face recognition systems. I
          developed a face recognition system using the LBPH (Local Binary
          Patterns Histogram) algorithm for marking attendance. This system
          involves capturing face samples, training a recognizer, and
          recognizing faces in real-time to track attendance for users, making
          the process efficient and automated.
          </li>
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>
          <li>
          Python Programming: My expertise includes writing Python scripts that
          utilize libraries like OpenCV for computer vision, pandas for data
          manipulation, and datetime for working with timestamps. I used these
          tools to build practical projects, such as the attendance system with
          face recognition mentioned earlier.
          </li>
